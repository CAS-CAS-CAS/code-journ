The goal is daily commits even when learning off of Youtube or messing around in a local playground(Why noot push afformention PG you say??, because sometimes you have to scrap and rebuild.. frequently!)

TODO LIST HERE FOR NOW:
 - make a way for digestable bits to be processed and gently reinforced
 - maybe make code to remind you
 -  decided permanent asset architechture (bonus learn to spell architecture)
